== Rails method parameter example

This example shows how to set method parameters using Rails. Although the same
functionality can be achieved with filters+instance variables, playing with instance
variables means tight coupling but we cant remove it as the template engine is also based
on that. This shows the coupling between the template engine and controller due to
such design decision (accessing instance variables directly).

Check the ProductsController for usage and ApplicationController for the simple
implementation strategy. This version runs only on 1.9 but as pointed on the ruby mailing
list it can also be run on 1.8.x with aditional libraries.

This is just a design example on what can be done.
